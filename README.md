# SNHU-CS225 System Analysis and Design Reflection

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted an online system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The system needed to manage user accounts, track progress, and allow administrators and instructors to manage courses, schedules, and student data efficiently.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did particularly well at clearly defining the system requirements and maintaining consistency between the business requirements document and the system design document. The structure of my documentation made it easy to trace how each customer need was addressed in the final design.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part, I would improve the detail in my use case descriptions by expanding on alternate flows and exceptions. This would make the design more complete and adaptable to real-world user scenarios.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the client interview transcript and focusing on features that improved accessibility, simplicity, and efficiency. Considering user needs is essential because even a technically sound system fails if it doesn’t serve its intended audience effectively.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In designing software, I try to balance clarity and scalability. Moving forward, I’d continue using modeling techniques like UML diagrams and maintain a strong focus on iterative feedback, ensuring that each design decision ties directly back to user goals and system functionality.
